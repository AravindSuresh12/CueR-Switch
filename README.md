# CueR-Switch

This is a Master's thesis work of building a modularizable biosensor using CueR transcription factor.

This code requires Julia version 1.9.x or above. In addition, it uses several external packages. To install these packages, start the REPL, e.g., from a Terminal window in VSCode in the root directory of the project (same directory as Include.jl) and issue the command:

julia> include("Include.jl")

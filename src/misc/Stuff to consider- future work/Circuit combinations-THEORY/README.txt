This folder contains possible sequences that can be tested on - Future ideas
 

1) CueR Sandwich- contains two CueR operators. CueR Op- T7 promoter- CueR Op- followed by deGFP
2) CueR 2X- contains two CueR operators. CueR Op- CueR op- T7 promoter- followed by deGFP
3) Linear T7 CueR gene contains T7-CueR gene (without the CueR operator and reporter protein)
4) Linear T7 CueR op deGFP - contains one CueR operator after T7 promoter-  contains deGFP solely controlled by the operator
5) CueROp 2x T7 A15G- contains two CueR operators after T7 promoter T7-promoter-CueROp-CueROp



The gene circuits in CFS are visualized like in the following

1) Try to produce only T7-CueR and T7-OCueR-deGFP separately
2) combine both parts of 1) to get a base sensor circuit
3) Try changing ratios of T7-CueR with sequences 1,2 and 5 to see sensor circuit's performance

Rationale for doing all these gene circuits is to tune sensing capacity of CueR operator so that with the data available, we can design a master system that can detect Cu+ in system of choice.
